    // it means wrapping up of the data members and methods in a class. it basically hide the code and data in single unit.
    //it means hiding unnecessary details and implementation and showing the valuable information.

    // do we need to the exact working of the class to use the class. No this is Abstraction. any function like println is example of Abstraction.

    // Abstraction is solving a design level issue and Encapsulation is solving a implementation level issue. Abstraction focus on external stuff and Encapsulation focus on internal stuff.
    // Abstration is about gaining the information and encapsulation is about containing the information.
    // getter and setter indirectly access and this is called data hiding. this is encapsulation
    // for Abstraction we use abstract etc
    // Data Hiding is focused on security and Abstraction focus on hiding the complexcity. Encapsulation is subprocess of Data Hiding.
