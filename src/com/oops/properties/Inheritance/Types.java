    // Single Inheritance. when 1 class inherit another class. Box -> BoxWeight.

    // Multi Level Class. Box -> BoxWeight -> BoxPrice. super to call variables above it if parameters conflict

    // Multipe inheritance is not in java due to ambiguity and conflict. so we use Interface to do so. This is to avoid the "Diamond Problem", where ambiguity arises when two parent classes have the same method and a subclass inherits both

    // Hierarchical Inheritance one parent multipe child and only link to parent. 1 Class is inherited by multiple class.

    // Hybrid - basically a combination of all above or any of above three. we dont have it in java as it can have multiple inheritance. so see Interfaces
    //  Is Hybrid Inheritance supported in Java?
    //âœ… Yes, but only through interfaces.

    // cyclic inheritance. A class cannot be its own superclass. Java doesnt allow
